# Sales-Forecasting-for-German-Pharmacy-Chain

- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify sales trends, seasonality, and the impact of promotions and competition.
- Engineered features such as HasCompetition and Date-Based Features (Year, Month, Day) to improve model performance.
- Preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and merging multiple datasets.
- Built and evaluated Random Forest Regression and ARIMA Time Series models.
- Achieved RÂ² = 0.98 and RMSPE = 20.66% with the Random Forest model, effectively capturing long-term trends but showing limitations in predicting extreme sales spikes.
